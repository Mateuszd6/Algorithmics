Description: BFS algorithm. Time complexity: O(E+V). Space complexity: O(E+V).
Notes:
	  * This algorithm works for undirected graphs, as it doesn't metter from which
		vertex start, algorithm will always find every vertex in whole connected component.
	  * Algorith behavour for directed graphs is random.
	  * See usage example for details.
