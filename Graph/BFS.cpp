Description: BFS algorithm. Time complexity: O(E+V). Space complexity: O(E+V).
Notes:
       * This algorithm is used to travere graph in breadth-first way and perform a given
         action in every vertex.
       * This algorithm works for undirected graphs, as it doesn't metter from which
         vertex start, algorithm will always find every vertex in whole connected component.
       * Algorith behavour for directed graphs is random.
       * See usage example for details.
