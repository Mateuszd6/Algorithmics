Description: Dijkstra shortest-path algorithm using binary heap. Time complexity: O(E*log(E)). Space complexity: O(E+V).
Notes:
       * This algorithm builds the shortest-paths-tree over the given graph, finding the shortest path from given source
	 vertex to every verex reachable it.
       * Custom binary heap is used here, but std::priority_queue fits as well, but < operator must be redefined, since 
	 this containter is a max heap, when here min heap is needed.
       * This algorithm works for both type of graps: directed and undirected.
