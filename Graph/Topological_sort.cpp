Description: Topological sort algorithm using DFS. Time complexity: O(E+V). Space complexity: O(V).
Notes:
       * Probably the fastest topological sort algorithm.
       * Since the problem is related to the directed acyclic graphs, input graph must respect these requirements.

//============== USAGE EXAMPLE ===================

//Empty struct as vertices need no more additional info.
struct Empty { Empty() {} };

int main()
{
    Graph<Empty, Empty> *g = new Graph<Empty, Empty>(7, directed);
    g->AddEdge(0, 2, Empty());
    g->AddEdge(1, 3, Empty());
    g->AddEdge(3, 4, Empty());
    g->AddEdge(2, 4, Empty());
    g->AddEdge(3, 2, Empty());
    g->AddEdge(6, 0, Empty());
    g->AddEdge(5, 0, Empty());
    g->AddEdge(5, 1, Empty());
    std::cout << (* g) << "\nTopologically sorted vertices: ";
    int *sortedVertices = TopologicalSort(* g);

        std::cout << sortedVertices[i] << " ";
    // Output:
    //Graph with 7 vertices, directed:
    //0:  2
    //1:  3
    //2:  4
    //3:  4 2
    //4:
    //5:  0 1
    //6:  0
    //
    //Topologically sorted vertices: 6 5 1 3 0 2 4
