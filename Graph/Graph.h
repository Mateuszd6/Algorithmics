// VertexInfo is a class for aditional vertex info to store. 
// By defauly vertex store a list (std::vertor here) of all the edges going out from it.
// If no aditional info is required use simply empty struct.
// NOTE: Mulitedges in this graph are allowed, which means that it is possible 
//		 to have more than one edge connecting two vertices.
